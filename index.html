            <div class="subtag text-sm">At the school level, Board of Open Schooling and Skill Education, Sikkim
                (BOSSE), National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) provides opportunities for continuing education to
                those who missed completing school education. 1.4 million students are enrolled at the secondary and
                higher secondary level through open and distance learning.[133] In 2012 various state governments also
                introduced "State Open School" to provide distance education.In India there are regular schools and
                special schools.[138] Special schools provide education for children with different disabilities.[138]
                Special schools can be beneficial to DHH children, and provide a better education than they would
                receive in a regular school.[138] However, these schools aren't available for every deaf child.[138]
                Sometimes they are located too far from a child's home.[138] Another reason a child may have to attend a
                regular school is if they receive hearing technology.[138] Since India focuses on hearing and speaking
                for the deaf, hearing technology is encouraged.

            <div class="tag text-big">Lets Grow Together</div>
            <div class="subtag text-sm">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by
                each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a
                'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal responsibility
                for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and
                eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the policies,
                plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast.[138] Once a child receives hearing
                technology it is believed that they can attend regular schools.[139] Even with hearing technology, DHH
                children still need special education in order to succeed.[138] This puts them at a significant
                disadvantage in regular school and can cause them to fall behind academically, linguistically, and
                developmentally.[138] For these reasons, many deaf children receive poor education or no education at
                all, causing the illiteracy rate of deaf children to rise.[138]

            <div class="tag text-big">Deaf education in India</div>
            <div class="subtag text-sm">There is a history of educating the deaf in India, however, there is no single
                clear approach to their education.[138] This stems from conditions, some similar to those faced around
                the world, and others unique to India.[138] For example, prior to independence of India, there were not
                clear laws and protections for the disabled.[138] Since independence, advancements have been made for
                rights of the disabled, but this has not fully tackled the issue. Education in India in regular schools
                and deaf schools has problems.[139] Even in deaf schools, sign language isn't usually taught and
                used.[139] Some use a small amount of sign language but all of the deaf schools in India use or claim to
                use an oral approach.[139] Some deaf schools secretly teach sign language due to the stigma and beliefs
                surrounding the use of sign language, and disability in general, in India.[141] Children in deaf schools
                have to try to learn by hearing or reading lips and writing.[142] In hearing schools, the children have
                to do the same.[142] </div>
